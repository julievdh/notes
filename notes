- try above with hoku and kolohe 5' rest files 
- audited to separate exh from inh: 153b, 153c
- realigned files after auditing
- hoku (153b, DQ file 14): works fairly well, still some spikes in envelope, correlation not so clean. Need Resp Timing
- Kolohe (153c, DQ file 15): works fairly well, correlation ehh. Have resp timing.
