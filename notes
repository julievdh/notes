- rest5envelopes_exh to do exhales only. audited hua 5' rest file separate inhales, exhales. detect peak, 95% energy duration. correlate with SUMMARYDATA from pneumotach. 

21 july 2017
- try above with hoku and kolohe 5' rest files 
- audited to separate exh from inh: 153b, 153c
- realigned files after auditing
- hoku (153b, DQ file 14): works fairly well, still some spikes in envelope, correlation not so clean. Need Resp Timing
- Kolohe (153c, DQ file 15): works fairly well, correlation ehh. Have resp timing.
- Did RESPTIMING for Hua, Hoku. Saved in _resp.mat files 
- DQ ECG data checks: which are good, which are not, which have undergone final check

- working on ECG data final check for Andreas. 140z and 141y still have to finish

24 july 2017
- rest5envelopes
- found error in plotting for rest5envelopes: wasn't plotting integral of env (duplicate plots in subplot!) 
- integrated audited exhale, too. added to subplot. 
- run for files 13, 14, 15
- had to reaudit Lono 5'rest for exhales only, realigned with exhale only CUE 
- evalcorr.m to evaluate correlation. BUT need to flip correlation x and y: use sound to estimate pneum
- audited all ECG except 141y. Are there two overlapping signals, one lower Freq and one higher Freq? Ughhhhh

10 Aug 2017 [back from vacation]
- added RMSE to evalcorr
