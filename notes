- rest5envelopes_exh to do exhales only. audited hua 5' rest file separate inhales, exhales. detect peak, 95% energy duration. correlate with SUMMARYDATA from pneumotach. 

21 july 2017
- try above with hoku and kolohe 5' rest files 
- audited to separate exh from inh: 153b, 153c
- realigned files after auditing
- hoku (153b, DQ file 14): works fairly well, still some spikes in envelope, correlation not so clean. Need Resp Timing
- Kolohe (153c, DQ file 15): works fairly well, correlation ehh. Have resp timing.
- Did RESPTIMING for Hua, Hoku. Saved in _resp.mat files 
- DQ ECG data checks: which are good, which are not, which have undergone final check

23 july 2017
- working on ECG data final check for Andreas. 140z and 141y still have to finish

24 july 2017
- rest5envelopes
- found error in plotting for rest5envelopes: wasn't plotting integral of env (duplicate plots in subplot!) 
- integrated audited exhale, too. added to subplot. 
- run for files 13, 14, 15
- had to reaudit Lono 5'rest for exhales only, realigned with exhale only CUE 
- evalcorr.m to evaluate correlation. BUT need to flip correlation x and y: use sound to estimate pneum
- audited all ECG except 141y. Are there two overlapping signals, one lower Freq and one higher Freq? Ughhhhh

10 Aug 2017 [back from vacation]
- added RMSE to evalcorr
- switched axes for regression: use sound to estimate measured params (rest5envelopes_exh)
- fixed RESPTIMING for 153a - overestimated exhalation duration. * still have to do for 153b, 153c * 

11 Aug 2017
- Fixed RESPTIMING for 153b, 153c; re-ran rest5envelopes_exh
- Looked at Trial44 ChestBand, waiting until meeting with Peter and Kristian Monday. 
- Audited gm15_266a for breath counts (and revived surfDetect.m!)

14 Aug 2017
- Finished gm15_266a audit
- Met with Kristian and Peter re: Chest Band and other data. 

15 Aug 2017
- Other ECG files for Andreas: 136z, 144z, 146z [even though poor quality recordings]
- ChestBand Trial22: reselected band peaks, new calculation of prominence
- Calibrated other ChestBand pneumo files, exported, ran through DOLPHIN_FLOW_MR_jvdH. Emailed Austin re: Trial 36. Still have to export-run 60 and 61, but calibrated.
